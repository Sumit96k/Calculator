CALCULATOR

This is a simple calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Math.js library to perform mathematical evaluations. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the code:

HTML Structure
The HTML creates a table for the calculator's layout, with buttons for numbers, basic arithmetic operators, a clear button (c), and an equal sign (=) to compute the result.
An input field is used to display the numbers and the result of calculations.

CSS Styling
The table and input elements are styled to be centered on the page, with the buttons having a consistent size, background color, and rounded corners.

JavaScript Functionality
The script includes functions to handle displaying values, solving mathematical expressions, and clearing the input field.
The Math.js library is used to safely evaluate mathematical expressions.
